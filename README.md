1. Clone the Latest Cluster Toolkit 

```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cluster-toolkit.git
```

2. Do the gh pr checkout 4583

```
cd cluster-toolkit
gh pr checkout 4583
```

Switched to branch 'netapp-volume'
```

3. Make sure the terraform version is at the latest Terraform version. The blueprint provided was tested with Terraform v1.15.0-dev on linux_amd_64.

Then one can use the cluster Toolkit ./gcluster command to deploy the cluster:

```
./gcluster deploy -w netapp-h4d.yaml
```

## Validation:

1. we see netapp file system on all the instance and it is working with Filestore deployment:
```
$ df -h
Filesystem                      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs                        7.7G     0  7.7G   0% /dev
tmpfs                           7.7G     0  7.7G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs                           7.7G  8.5M  7.7G   1% /run

```

2. Slurm is working 

```
$ sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
h4d*         up   infinite      1   idle netapph4d-h4dnodeset-0
```

3. Test job: (Created a test file: thomas-test on Netapp)
```  
$ srun ls /netapp
thomas-test
```
```
$ srun cat /netapp/thomas-test
This is test from Thomas
```
